        <h1> Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration </h1>
        <p class="padding"> Heya, welcome to my blog. My core values are self-improvement, work ethic and family which I’ll elaborate on whilst adding to this blog over the span of me 
            attending to Dev Academy!

            The first core value being self-improvement, I think there’s multiple ways to interpret what self improvement means and other people will have different views 
            to what that means. In my opinion, self-improvement is the sense of being the best person I know I can be and bettering myself in anyway possible whether it 
            be knowledge or just treating others better on a daily basis. These are the things I find most important in life and know that it’ll help me through whatever 
            career I choose to take down the line. 
                
            Second core value: Work ethic! Similar to the first value of mine, I believe that maintaining a good work ethic and working my hardest in every situation is 
            key to (also being the best I can be) feeling productive and good about myself whenever completing given tasks or even tasks I’ve given myself. It also shows 
            others around me that I am capable of doing what I am told, and that I am not afraid to give something a shot whether I’m familiar with it or not.
                
            And finally the third core value would be family, which is because family and friends are what have shaped me into the person I am today, and give me the most 
            valuable reason to work hard and show me a representation of what to strive for everyday. 
                
            I’ve never really had an experience where I’ve been trying to work with others and there’s been tension or resistance, I’ve found that working my hardest helps 
            others also want to work hard. My strengths that will help with my learning journey is how persistent I am. Even through the first sprint I’ve been stuck a few 
            times and came back multiple times to try solve whatever’s been interrupting my flow.</p>
