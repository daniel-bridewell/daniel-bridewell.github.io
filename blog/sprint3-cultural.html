                    <p class="column">Emotional intelligence is how well you're able to work with others and how others are able to work with you.
                          It comes down to your mindset for how you work, and being able to relate to and being fun or friendly to interact
                          with. The difference from EQ to IQ is that IQ are your actual tech skills, in this case our IQ would be our
                          ability of HTML/CSS or whatever language we would use.</p>

                      IQ stuff such as coding, doesn't make them better if their EQ is horrible and people are unable to work with them, 
                      as Emotional Intelligence is important for communicating and working together. And that's why EQ is so important, 
                      teamwork is a huge role in almost every task we put ourselves to in any career we choose to take, you can be 
                      an incredibly smart person but if no one wants to work with you you're not getting the most productive work ethic 
                      you could be getting.</p>
