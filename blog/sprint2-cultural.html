        <h1> Learning Plan </h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="padding"> My long term goal is really to just to be a good developer and succeed in the field, it's something I enjoy doing and have so far loved learning about everyday.
                
                I really want to become better at just talking to people confidently, not that comunication is a weakness of mine  just that I feel like I could be a lot better at it, or I'm just quite hard on myself for things like this. 
                I'm awful with words and strive to better myself at putting my thoughts across better.
                
                My biggest strength is persistent, I don't give up super easily and take pride in how committed I am to each task, 
                and have some sort of fear for disappointing myself and others.
                
                I always work my hardest and hope that other people will see it and maybe inspire them to also work their hardest, 
                regardless of if i'm stuck and not able to do something, and always trying to be as productive as can be given the 
                hours I am required to work, including for foundations where pretty much 9am-5pm is just set for me to work on 
                whatever I'm needed to do during these sprints, so time management isn't an issue. 
                
                For the facilitation team, I only really expect guidance and to know that they wouldn't let us stray away from 
                our goals, I know that we can seek help if needed and that's all I really needed.</p>
