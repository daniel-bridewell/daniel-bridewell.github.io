                  <p class="title">Pseudocode</p>
                  <p>Pseudocode is what helps us break down our code into a step by step guide, making way more sense of what you need to do before applying yourself 
                    to the code and trying to figure it out.

                  <p class="title"> Asking Peers for help</p>
                  <p> This is one I had to do a lot, and thanks Raaya and Dan!! Asking peers doesn't have to be embarrassing or anything, everyone here is struggling, 
                    maybe they're ahead or behind but we're all learning this together, and asking eachother for help is a great way to bounce ideas off eachother and 
                    you'll learn way more than you think.

                    <p class="title">Console Log</p>
                    <p>Console logging is what made my life somewhat easier during the katas, being able to SEE the information from arrays is a huge help and for me 
                      it's absolutely crucial to solving problems.

                  <p class="title"> Reading Error Messages</p>
                  <p>This is another crucial technique that well help tremendously through any problem you have, sometimes you won't understand what the Error messages mean but 
                    it starts to come to you and even if you don't completely understand what it's telling you, remembering the error and then eventually solving the 
                    problem helps a lot for understanding the errors in general.

                  <p class="title"> Asking coaches for help</p>
                  <p> Same as asking peers for help, but a more in depth way of really understanding things about what you're doing and just being run through 
                    every step, it's a great way to actually understand how everythings working and that's one of the big steps to solving each problem.

                  <p class="title"> Googling </p>
                  <p> Another huge technique and this one is more of an obvious one, Google is your best friend as an developer, googling how to join strings together, 
                    or how to split things, it's super helpful and everyone should be doing this regardless.

                <p class="title"> My biggest problem </p>
                <p> During the Super FizzBuzz kata, I had no idea about how people were seeing the array (which I know now was me being a tad stupid), everyone seemed to be 
                  miles ahead of where I was and I started stressing really hard and losing hope.

                  Fast forward to me remembering what console.log does then multiple lightbulbs lighting up in my head simultaneously. After figuring that out I was able 
                  to use pseudocode to plan out exactly what needed to be done and the rest kind of just came to me! The big thing I learn was the use console.log to your 
                  advantage to see the information you need to see, and pseudocode was super useful to plan ahead and know why you're doing each step and what it's doing.
