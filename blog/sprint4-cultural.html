              <p class="title">Neuroplasticity</p>
              <p>Neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to be able to change continuously throughout your life and without this, you would be left unable to develop your brain 
                or even recover from any injuries sustained. The same thing goes for learning, Neuroplasticity is what makes us acquire new skills (like coding as an example for me), 
                and you can get even better results by understanding Neuroplasticity and how it shapes our brains.
                <br>
                <br>
                Ways to increase your neuroplasticity are just like normal acts of healthy things you could already be doing such as exercising, sleeping enough, eating a 
                healthier diet and just to continue learning new things.

              <p class="title">Growth Mindset</p>
              <p>Growth Mindset is the thought of knowing you will get smarter, gain new abilities etc., It's understanding that putting in the work and believing that what you're 
                doing will make you grow stronger and achieve your goals over-time. I think the way that I'm going to integrate a growth mindset into my work is to start 
                not getting too upset at myself for not being able to do certain tasks, and keep reminding myself that I'll eventually gain the knowledge I need for certain things 
                by continuing working hard keeping a positive mindset.

              <center><p class="title">Learning Plan</p>
              <p> In terms of intergrating this with my learning plan, I think it's going to help heavily with all my current and future tasks to be done, understanding that 
                any obstacle that blocking me or making me feel like I'm unable to do it will be finished over time and help me in future. The growth mindset I think is going 
                to have the bigger impact on me personally for sure, and is something I'm going to be working on heavily during my time at Dev Academy and the future.
